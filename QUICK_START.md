## üìä Your Data

**80 CSV files** in [data/](data/) directory:
- 10 leagues (E0, E1, D1, D2, I1, I2, SP1, SP2, F1, F2)
- 9 seasons (2017-18 to 2025-26)
- 31,623 matches total

**Main table:** `all_matches`

**Key columns:**
- `Date`, `Season`, `League`
- `HomeTeam`, `AwayTeam`
- `FTHG`, `FTAG` (full-time goals)
- `FTR` (result: H/D/A)
- `HS`, `AS` (shots)
- `HC`, `AC` (corners)

## üîç Common Queries

### Find matches for a team
```sql
SELECT Date, League, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG
FROM all_matches
WHERE HomeTeam = 'Liverpool' OR AwayTeam = 'Liverpool'
ORDER BY Date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### League table (simplified)
```sql
SELECT
    HomeTeam as team,
    COUNT(*) as games,
    SUM(CASE WHEN FTR = 'H' THEN 3 WHEN FTR = 'D' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as points,
    SUM(FTHG) as goals_for,
    SUM(FTAG) as goals_against
FROM all_matches
WHERE Season = '2425' AND League = 'E0'
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY points DESC;
```

### High-scoring matches
```sql
SELECT Date, League, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG,
       (FTHG + FTAG) as total_goals
FROM all_matches
ORDER BY total_goals DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Over 2.5 goals percentage
```sql
SELECT
    League,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN (FTHG + FTAG) > 2.5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as over_2_5_pct
FROM all_matches
WHERE Season = '2425'
GROUP BY League
ORDER BY over_2_5_pct DESC;
```

## üéØ Quick Tips

1. **Harlequin keyboard shortcuts:**
   - `Ctrl+Enter` - Run query
   - `Ctrl+Q` - Quit
   - `F2` - Format SQL
   - `Ctrl+H` - Query history

2. **CSV files are queried directly** - no need to import!

3. **Performance tip:** Export to Parquet for faster queries:
   ```python
   python3 -c "
   import duckdb
   con = duckdb.connect()
   con.execute(\"COPY (SELECT * FROM 'data/*.csv') TO 'all_matches.parquet'\")
   "
   ```

4. **Season codes:**
   - `2425` = 2024-25 season
   - `2324` = 2023-24 season
   - etc.

5. **League codes:**
   - `E0` = Premier League
   - `E1` = Championship
   - `SP1` = La Liga
   - `D1` = Bundesliga
   - `I1` = Serie A
   - `F1` = Ligue 1
